How to program the FPGA:


1) Connect the FPGA board to the PC via USB

2) Open a command window on the PC and cd to the synth directory

3) Type one of the following commands:


To load the bit file to the RAM inside the FPGA part: butterflyprog -v -d OneShot\ B -f ../xise/oneshot.bit
(This will take less than a second)

To flash the bit file to the EEPROM: butterflyprog.exe -v -d OneShot\ B -f ../xise/oneshot.bit -b bscan_spi_xc3s250e.bit -sa -r
(This will take a few minutes to finish)
